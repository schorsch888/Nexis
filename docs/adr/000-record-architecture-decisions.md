# ADR-000: Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to document and track significant architectural decisions in the Nexis project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document key decisions.

ADR format based on [Michael Nygard's template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):

- **Title**: ADR-NNN: Brief decision title
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're addressing?
- **Decision**: What is the change?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

## Consequences

- Decisions are documented and traceable
- New team members can understand why decisions were made
- We can revisit decisions when context changes
